## Introduction:

GiveToy, is a website for toy donation and exchange of toys. This project was thought due to the tons of plastic waste generated by the discarded toys that every year ends up in landfills, we can notice there is a need to reduce and give a more ecological destination for these toys. But the project goes beyond aiming at reducing waste generated by discarding toys it is being created to help generate a social responsibility too.
To carry out the creation of the site, at first I tried to develop an ecommerce project using Django, to later adapt it to a multiple ecommerce project which would give the possibility for several people to post their donations and see the posts of other people and then they could send your information to the donors of the products that interest you to them get the change to meet up and receive the donation.

### Report:
To develop this website I followed the presented references, tutorials and the knowledge acquired during the classes. As the main intention of the project was at first to follow a line of reasoning and then to deploy to several users, but during the creation process I had some difficulties and could not finish the project. So, not being able to make sure that all users could upload the objects to be donated, so they could only make the request. I also didn't have time to create the page where it is possible to check the requests made for the donated items. Despite not being able to finish it I learned a lot and managed to do most of the project so I am happy with the result achieved
