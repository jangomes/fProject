## Introduction:

GiveToy, is a website for toy donation and exchange of toys. This project was thought due to the tons of plastic waste generated by the discarded toys that every year ends up in landfills, we can notice there is a need to reduce and give a more ecological destination for these toys. But the project goes beyond aiming at reducing waste generated by discarding toys it is being created to help generate a social responsibility too.
